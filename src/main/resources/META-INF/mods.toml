A mod designed to encourage dietary variety!

It does so by rewarding the player with customizable benefits depending on how diverse their diet is. These benefits
require maintaining a diverse diet, rather than a one-time consumption.
Instead of using the carrot, we use the (sweet) potato! Whatever that means...
